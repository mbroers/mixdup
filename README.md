# mixdup
teensy based midi controller

Based on the awesome [Control Surface](https://github.com/tttapa/Control-Surface) teensyduino library.

v1 has two rows of switches

v2 has 3 rows of switches, ICs moved to back of board so they are socketable (this resulted in a change to the teensy code as well), and the pots/sliders are a bit more spaced out along with some other minor cleanups.
