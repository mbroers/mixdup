# mixdup
teensy based midi controller

Based on the awesome [Control Surface](https://github.com/tttapa/Control-Surface) teensyduino library.

The v1 board works and I am in the process of slight improvements for a v2 that can be expanded into other modules.

Many things are forthcoming, once I have verified the v2 board works as expected.
- [ ] BOM
- [ ] v2 teensyduino for extra switches
- [ ] Panel vector/FPE files
- [ ] Probably a v2.2 board with a bit more potentiometer spacing, and clearer silk screen
- [ ] Enclosure plans
- [ ] Initial expander with Effects Racks capabilities and 5 band eq
- [ ] DAC
- [ ] Live macros to create default map
